# Lucy's Guardiens
Did you find the oversoul?



## About 
Our clan is developed around fun and friendship first, skills and achievements second. The skill level within the clan varies from very new players to D1 Alpha veterans, this combination of players allows us to beat every aspect of the game such as nightfall's, raids and occasionally some of us even go flawless in trials :).

Many of the veterans are more than willing to spend more than a few hours to help other guardians completing achievements.

The clan aims to use this page to schedule events such as raids, nightfall's and other challenges, feel free to join any event you see however, please do see it as a commitment, it's not great to have only 4 or 5 people show up to go and kill riven! (all of us understand last moment things happen)

When joining a game, ensure that you're in the Discord. so that we can communicate with you during raids etc.
